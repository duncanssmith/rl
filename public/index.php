Portland is well known mainly for its stone, used to rebuild London after the great fire in the 17th Century. It is also the "Isle of Slingers" in Thomas Hardy's novel <u>The Well Beloved</u>. It has many places that have an extraordinary charm and unusual beauty. West Weares, a spectacular walk where quarried stone tumbles into the sea, is a two minute walk from the studio, and Tout Quarry, a site of scientific interest are just two examples. You can swim on calm days in the corner of Chesil Bay. There is also diving off Chesil Beach and in Portland Harbour, windsurfing and sailing. A yacht club opened in 2004 later becoming the home of the sailing events of the 2012 Olympics. Close to the studios are a caf&eacute;, an award-winning restaurant, and the Cove House Inn. It is a five minute walk to Fortuneswell where there is a chemist, a Post Office, a supermarket, a caf&eacute;, a fish and chip shop, and an Indian and a Chinese &quot;take-away&quot; restaurant. </p>

                                    The property known as Ranters Lodge. The Owner known as Judith Frost. The Renter and their party shall henceforth in this document be known as the Client.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    To reserve the property the Client should e-mail, phone or text the Owner and ask about availability. Hopefully a suitable rental period is agreed.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The Client should send the 20% non returnable deposit either by bank transfer or cheque to the owner (Unless otherwise agreed with the Owner). When the deposit has been received by the owner the property will be booked to the Client and the remainder of the monies are due 4 weeks before the start of the rental. If the booking is made after this period the whole of the monies are due at the time of booking (Unless otherwise agreed with the Owner).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If the Client has to cancel their booking, the Owner will make every effort to re-let the property. Money will be returned to them -10%, if another Client is found. If that is not the case then the Client will be liable for the entire cost of the Holiday. The Owner suggests that the Client takes out holiday insurance to cover any loss they may incur if they cancel the booking. If for any reason the monies have not been received by the Owner, prior to the start of the holiday and the Client has to cancel their booking the Owner would still expect the whole sum owed to be paid unless another client was found and then it would be 10% of the sum owed.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The maximum number of people to reside in the property shall not exceed 3 unless the Owner has given permission in writing.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The rental period shall commence at 12 noon on the first day and finish at 12 noon on the day of departure.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The property is a No Smoking Property. The Client agrees that no one in his or her party will smoke inside the property. This is a condition of the insurance
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The Owner will accept one well-behaved dog as long as the Owner is advised in advance. Extra care must be taken to clean when leaving the property, The dog must be kept off the beds and the soft furnishings and any dog mess removed immediately from the shared yard. The dog must not be left alone in the property if likely to be stressed.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The Client agrees to take good care of the property and to leave the property in a clean and tidy condition at the end of the rental period. There may not be a cleaner between every rental (This is reflected in the price charged) so it is important that the property is left as the Client would expect to find it.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The Client agrees to notify the owner of any defects in the property and the Owner will make every effort to rectify the situation as soon as possible by either repair or replacement which ever is reasonably possible.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Complaints must be made immediately to the owner by the Client, so the owner has the opportunity to rectify the situation. No refund will be given if the Client fails to notify the Owner of their complaint before the end of their stay.
